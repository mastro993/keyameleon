### Issue #5 Activity-Triggered Switching seams

- **Activation Activity classification** (domain pure): `PhysicalKeyboardEventKind` press/repeat/release; release not Activation Activity.
- **Switching coordinator** via `KeyameleonSetupModel`: Active Physical Keyboard, request exact Keyboard Assignment, exact identifier readback.
- **Input Source select/verify** protocol: `InputSourceSelecting` (TIS boundary).
- **Event observe** protocol: `PhysicalKeyboardEventObserving` (CoreHID listen-only; no seize).
- **Catalog**: serviceID → Physical Keyboard for attribution.

Defaults:

- Coalesce select when wanted assignment already verified active (story 57 minimal).
- Failures leave input unchanged; no toast (#5); no retry loop.
- Active Physical Keyboard not persisted across restart.
